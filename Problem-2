Title - Haziq Plays Football
Haziq likes to play football with his friends. They played a number of matches and surprisingly, every match was a tie, so they decided to declare the winner 
with penalty shoot-out. As they didn't know the penalty shoot-out rules, they just decided to take 20 shots alternatively (each team takes 10 shots).
The standard rules are:

The teams will take shots alternatively.
1. At first, each team will take five penalty shots.
2. If one team does not have more goals than the other after these five shots, the shoot-out will proceed to sudden death.
3. In between of first 10 kicks, If one team has an advantage over other which can't be compensated, 
then the team with the advantage will be declared winner at that instant i.e. before the completion of 10 kicks.
4. In sudden death, each team will take at most five more shots. Everytime after both teams take a shot, 
the following rule is used: if one team has scored more goals than the other, that team is the winner.
5. If each team has taken 10 shots and the winner still cannot be decided, the result will be a tie.
