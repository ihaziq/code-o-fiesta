You are given a grid of size M X N, where each cell in the grid is either '1' (representing a star) or '0' (representing empty space). 
Stars can form pattern in two ways: Single Star: A single cell with the value '1' represents a single star. (Not adjacent to any other 
star horizontally or vertically). Star Cluster: If a group of adjacent cells ( horizontally or vertically) with the value '1' forms a 
connected cluster, it represents a star cluster. Write a function 'countStars(grid)' that takes the 'grid' as input and returns the total 
count of stars, including both single stars and star clusters. The main() function is:

int main() {
    int M, N;
    cin >> M;
    cin >> N;
    int grid[M][N];
    for(int i=0;i<M;i++){
        for(int j=0;j<N;j++){
            cin >> grid[i][j];
        }
    }
    return 0;
}
Input Format

Rows in Grid (M)
Columns in Grid (N)
2D matrix of size 'M X N' containing only '0' and '1'.
Constraints

1<=M, N<=1000
